[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker, stream engine and more. Redis is known for its high performance, low latency, and scalability, making it suitable for real-time applications.

### Documents

[Documents](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/get-started/document-database/) in Redis are data structures in [JSON](https://www.json.org/) format that can contain various [data types](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/). These documents are stored in memory, allowing for fast and efficient access to data.

```json
{
  "name": "Marcos",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "Madrid"
}
```

In case you haven't noticed, documents don't need to have a primary key, since Redis assigns a unique identifier to each document. We'll look at that in the next section.

### Groups

Redis doesn't have traditional "collections" like [SQL databases](/databases#sql) or document stores. However, you can organize data into logical groups using key naming patterns. Each document is uniquely identified by its complete key.

<FileTree>

- local (redis:6379)
  - messages
    - 001 `messages:001`
    - 002 `messages:002`
  - codes
    - 001 `codes:001`
    - 002 `codes:002`
    - 003 `codes:003`

</FileTree>

You can query groups using patterns like `user:*` to find all keys matching that pattern. There are a few tools for working with Redis instances like [Redis CLI](https://redis.io/docs/latest/cli/) or [Redis Insight](https://redis.io/insight/) with GUI.

### Redis Cloud

[Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/cloud/) is a managed service that provides a fully managed Redis instance in the cloud. It offers features like automatic scaling, high availability, and data persistence. You can sign up for a free account and create a Redis instance in minutes.
