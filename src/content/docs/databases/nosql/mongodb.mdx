[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It is ideal for semi-structured data, rapid development, and horizontal scaling. Is designed to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads, making it suitable for modern web applications.

### Documents

[Documents](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/document/) are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. They are represented in [BSON](https://bsonspec.org/) format (a binary extension of JSON) and can contain complex data structures, including arrays and nested documents.

The data is a key-value structure where the key is a string and the value can be of various [types](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/bson-types/#std-label-bson-types). Field keys cannot be `null` or `undefined`.

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"),
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 29,
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
    zip: "12345"
  },
  hobbies: ["reading", "traveling"],
}
```

As you may have noticed in the previous example, each document has a field [`_id`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/document/#the-_id-field) that acts as a unique primary key for each document. This field is mandatory and immutable. It is generated automatically if not provided.

### Collections

MongoDB stores documents in [collections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections/#collections). They are the equivalent of analogous to tables in relational databases. However, unlike tables, collections do not enforce a fixed schema. This allows to define documents with varying structures within the same collection.

However, you can enforce a schema using [JSON Schema validation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/schema-validation/). If you try to insert a document that does not conform to the defined schema, MongoDB will reject the operation.

### Atlas Platform

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) is a fully managed cloud database service provided by MongoDB. It offers features such as automated backups, scaling, and monitoring, making it easier to deploy and manage MongoDB databases in the cloud.

It offers a free tier, which is great for learning and small projects. You can connect to Atlas using various [programming language-specific drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/).

### Compass GUI

[MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) is the official GUI for MongoDB. It provides a visual interface for interacting with your MongoDB data, allowing you to explore your data, run queries, and perform various database operations without needing to write code.
