[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It is ideal for semi-structured data, rapid development, and horizontal scaling. Is designed to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads, making it suitable for modern web applications.

### Documents

Data is stored in [documents](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/document/), which are similar to [JSON](https://www.json.org/) or [BSON](https://bsonspec.org/) objects. Each document contains key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be various data types, including arrays and nested documents.

```jsonc title="Example Document"
{
  "_id": ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"),
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown"
  },
  "hobbies": ["reading", "traveling"]
}
```

The document schema contains a unique `_id` field that serves as the primary key for the document. If not provided, MongoDB automatically generates an [`ObjectId`](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/bson-types/#std-label-objectid) for this field.

Documents are grouped into [collections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections/#collections), which are similar to tables in relational databases. Collections do not enforce a fixed schema, allowing for flexibility in the structure of documents.

### Atlas Platform

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) is a fully managed cloud database service provided by MongoDB. It offers features such as automated backups, scaling, and monitoring, making it easier to deploy and manage MongoDB databases in the cloud.

It offers a free tier, which is great for learning and small projects. You can connect to Atlas using various [programming language-specific drivers](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/).

### Compass

[MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) is the official GUI for MongoDB. It provides a visual interface for interacting with your MongoDB data, allowing you to explore your data, run queries, and perform various database operations without needing to write code.

### When to Use

- **Semi-structured or evolving data** - MongoDB shines when dealing with data that doesn't fit a rigid schema or when your data structure needs to adapt frequently without costly migrations.
- **JSON-first APIs** - If you're building web or mobile applications that work natively with JSON, MongoDB's document-oriented model aligns perfectly with your API design, eliminating unnecessary transformation layers.
- **Horizontal scalability** - MongoDB supports sharding out of the box, allowing you to scale your database incrementally by distributing data across multiple servers as your needs grow.
- **Agile development** - For rapid prototyping and iterative development cycles where flexibility is paramount, MongoDB removes the friction of predefined schemas, letting you evolve your data model alongside your application.
